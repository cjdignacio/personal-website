      <p>

        A self-described elusive permutation and an advocate of self-satisfying spontaneity, Jay Ignacio’s unpredictability and nonchalant energy has been cited as his artistic and strategic inspiration.<br><br>

        As a financial scholar of an exclusive institution during High School, he learned that recognizing the absurdity of his mundane work-life enabled the potential to escape from its powerlessness. Eventually, he went to work, unearthing optimism from nihilism—treating the latter as a boundless fountain of human insight and truth.<br><br>

        Harnessing the power of one’s intent remains the philosophy that guides his work—a constant meditation recognizing that form must always follow function, and that a function must always challenge itself to be as certain and as absolute as it can possibly be.<br><br>

        While he knows he has a long way to go in terms of mastering the art of leveraging one's intent, he acknowledges that recognizing it is the first step to take in a journey toward becoming a bona fide Strategist and Creative—one he has already begun.
